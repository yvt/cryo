*Extend the lifetime of a reference. Safely.*

Requires Rust 1.26.0 or later.

This crate provides a cell-like type `Cryo` that is similar to `RefCell`
except that it constrains the lifetime of its borrowed value
through a runtime check mechanism, erasing the compile-time lifetime
information. The lock guard `CryoRef` created from `Cryo` is
`'static` and therefore can be used in various situations that require
`'static` types, including:

 - Store `CryoRef` temporarily in a `std::any::Any`-compatible container.
 - Capture a reference to create a [Objective-C block](https://crates.io/crates/block).

This works by, when a `Cryo` is dropped, blocking the current thread until
all references to the contained value are dropped so that none of them can
outlive the cell.

The constructor of `Cryo` is marked as `unsafe` because it's easy to
break various assumptions essential to memory safety if `Cryo` values are
not handled properly. Utility functions `with_cryo` and
`with_cryo_mut` ensure safety by providing access to `Cryo` values in a
controlled way.

## Examples

`with_cryo` and `Cryo`:

```rust
use std::thread::spawn;

let cell: usize = 42;

with_cryo(&cell, |cryo: &Cryo<usize>| {
    // Borrow `cryo` and move it into a `'static` closure.
    let borrow: CryoRef<usize> = cryo.borrow();
    spawn(move || { assert_eq!(*borrow, 42); });

    // Compile-time lifetime works as well.
    assert_eq!(*cryo.get(), 42);

    // When `cryo` is dropped, it will block until there are no other
    // references to `cryo`. In this case, `with_cryo` will not return
    // until the thread we just spawned completes execution.
});
```

`with_cryo_mut` and `CryoMut`:

```rust
with_cryo_mut(&mut cell, |cryo_mut: &CryoMut<usize>| {
    // Borrow `cryo_mut` and move it into a `'static` closure.
    let mut borrow: CryoMutWriteGuard<usize> = cryo_mut.write();
    spawn(move || { *borrow = 1; });

    // When `cryo_mut` is dropped, it will block until there are no other
    // references to `cryo_mut`.  In this case, `with_cryo_mut` will not
    // return until the thread we just spawned completes execution.
});
assert_eq!(cell, 1);
```

**Don't** do this:

```rust
// The following statement will deadlock because it attempts to drop
// `Cryo` while a `CryoRef` is still referencing it
let borrow = with_cryo(&cell, |cryo| cryo.borrow());
```

## Caveats

- While it's capable of extending the effective lifetime of a reference,
  it does not apply to nested references. For example, when
  `&'a NonStaticType<'b>` is supplied to the `Cryo`'s constructor, the
  borrowed type is `CryoRef<NonStaticType<'b>>`, which is still partially
  bound to the original lifetime.

## Details

### Feature flags

 - `parking_lot` â€” Specifies to use `parking_lot` instead of `std::sync`.

### Overhead

`Cryo<T>` incurs moderate overhead due to the uses of `Mutex` and
`Condvar`. This can be alleviated somewhat by using the `parking_lot`
feature flag.
